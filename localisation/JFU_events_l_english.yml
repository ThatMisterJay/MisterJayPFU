    pfu.28.d:0 "Japan is one of the hardest country to play in HOI4, as part of the new Japan rework it has received some new changes to align Japan more with historical realities.\n \n 1. China is hard to kill but can die, however this is not recommened until second wind focus. For spawn ins, you must also control: Guangzhou, Shanghai, Beijing and NOT control Sichuan, Yunnan, Hunan, Guizhou and Hefang, if you occupy one of these provinces you will also gain an industry debuff (can be found in discord's Japan channel). The more chinese states you own a bigger attack malus you will get against china, remove this from second wind focus (states can be found in the top right).\n \n2.  Japan's role in the game is to divert as much attention from the germans as possible. This is done by harrassing allied players, taking land and power projection. The more allied resources Japan ties up the less the allies can deploy for D-Day. Japan now gains 4 months of buffs upon Tora! Tora! Tora! along with the USA gaining a significant navy debuff these months. Use these buffs to take as much land as possible then dig in to hold it and harras the allies.\n \n3. Japan should use geogprahy to its advantage, taking as much land as a buffer will allow you greater freedom. Naval power is important, if your fleet is destroyed you are basically dead as you can no longer hold any of your overseas possessions. Don't gamble away your fleet in costly engagements unless you are certain to come out on top. Base Strike with a carrier fleet is best in the ocean while a trade interdicition Japan is better in the achipelagos. Kamikazes become available after 1943 or 5% capitluation, use them to fight the enemy navy \n \n4. DO NOT CHANGE DIVISION TEMPLATE NAMES, IF YOU WANT NEW TEMPLATES MAKE THEM FROM SCRATCH! \n \n5. Finally some allies may pursue a hard Germany first strategy, this will give you free reign in the east, use it to apply as much pressure as possiblen, every resource you divert away from a D-Day helps the axis. \n \n6. The USA has a decision tree to give attack bonuses against Japan by conducting the historic island hoping campaign, keep the islands garrisoned and be aware for us invasions if you wish to counter this."
