China is hard to kill but can die, however this is not recommended until second wind focus. For spawn ins, you must also control: Guangzhou, Shanghai, Beijing. The more Chinese states you own a bigger attack malus you will get against china, remove this from second wind focus (states can be found in the top right).\n\n2.  Japan's role in the game is to divert as much attention from the germans as possible. This is done by harrassing allied players, taking land and power projection. The more allied resources Japan ties up the less the allies can deploy for D-Day. Japan now gains 4 months of buffs upon Tora! Tora! Tora! along with the USA gaining a significant navy debuff these months. Use these buffs to take as much land as possible then dig in to hold it and harras the allies.\n \n3. Japan should use geogprahy to its advantage, taking as much land as a buffer will allow you greater freedom. Naval power is important, if your fleet is destroyed you are basically dead as you can no longer hold any of your overseas possessions. Don't gamble away your fleet in costly engagements unless you are certain to come out on top. Base Strike with a carrier fleet is best in the ocean while a trade interdiction Japan is better in the archipelagos. Kamikazes are available from focus, use them to fight the enemy navy \n\n4. DO NOT CHANGE DIVISION TEMPLATE NAMES, IF YOU WANT NEW TEMPLATES MAKE THEM FROM SCRATCH! \n\n5. Finally some allies may pursue a hard Germany first strategy, this will give you free reign in the east, use it to apply as much pressure as possible, every resource you divert away from a D-Day helps the axis. \n\n6. The USA has a decision tree to give attack bonuses against Japan by conducting the historic island hoping campaign, keep the islands garrisoned and be aware for us invasions if you wish to counter this."

In October 1941, Arthur Coles and Alexander Wilson, the two independent MPs who had been keeping the Coalition in office since 1940 (first under Menzies, then under Fadden), joined forces with Labor in defeating Fadden's budget and bringing the government down. Governor-General Lord Gowrie was reluctant to call an election for a Parliament barely a year old, especially given the international situation. He summoned Coles and Wilson and made them promise that if he named Curtin prime minister, they would support him for the remainder of the Parliament to end the instability in government. The independents agreed, and Curtin was sworn in as prime minister on 7 October, aged 56. He became the first and only prime minister to come from Western Australia"

After receiving news of the surrender, Bennett handed command of the 8th Division to the divisional artillery commander, Brigadier Cecil Callaghan, and—along with some of his staff officers—commandeered a small boat. They eventually made their way back to Australia, while between 15,000 and 20,000 Australian soldiers are reported to have been captured. Bennett blamed Percival and the Indian troops for the defeat, but Callaghan reluctantly stated that Australian units had been affected by the desertion of many men toward the end of the battle. Indeed, the Kappe Report, compiled by Colonels J.H. Thyer and C.H. Kappe, concedes that at most only two-thirds of the available Australian troops manned the final perimeter. Regardless, many British units were reported to have been similarly affected."
