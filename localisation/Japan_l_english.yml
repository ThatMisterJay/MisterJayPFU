 Jfujap.3.d:0 "Yesterday, [GetDateText], a date which will live in infamy, the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by the Empire of Japan.\n\nUnprovoked and unannounced, Pearl Harbor has been bombed by the IJN. The United States responded with furious outrage and a declaration of war, followed shortly by the rest of the Allies.\n\nThe attack has caused severe damage to America's fleet in the Pacific, and experts believe it will take several months for their force projection capabilities to recover."

 JAP_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Kai-Agano Class were an improvement on the Agano class in virtually every way. Their increased armor and armament were designed to meet growing Japanese demand for a strong heavy-cruiser class."
 JAP_battleship_3:0 "Ise Class"
 JAP_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Ise class were constructed during WWI, but saw many improvements in the 1930s. Originally classified as dreadnought battleships, the improved Ise was upgraded with increased armor, main-armament and anti-aircraft that could fight off virtually any foe."
 JAP_battleship_4:0 "Izumo Class"
 JAP_battleship_4_desc:0 "Taking from the design of the original Yamato class, the Izumo class concept moved the 3rd turret to the bow of the ship. Her heavy armor and front-facing armament insured a small profile when attacking. Her heavy secondary and anti-aircraft armament were huge improvements over previous Imperial Japanese battleships."
