    help_event.1.t:0 "Help with Host Options Expanded"
    help_event.1.d:0 "You clicked this option because you want some help with the mod! You have a couple options:"
    help_event.1.a:0 "Explain the voting please"
    help_event.1.b:0 "I don't understand moving factions"
    help_event.1.c:0 "Help me with moving countries"

    help_event.2.t:0 "Host Voting Help"
    help_event.2.d:0 "You asked for help about Host Voting. The host voting is calculated by the amount of people that voted. That means that if only one person voted, you can become host. It is NOT calculated by the amount of players. You will need at least 60% of the votes to win. The vote itself works as follows. If there is no host, at the start of the game a vote will pop up. This vote will last for 10 days as shown in the menu. In this time you can click a flag to vote. If the person that is voted for the most has sufficient votes, he/she will become the host. \n\nAlternatively, in this mod the host can be chosen through Gamerules. This is highly advised, as players will not need to vote at all."
    help_event.2.a:0 "Thanks!"

    help_event.3.t:0 "Moving Factions Help"
    help_event.3.d:0 "You asked for help about Moving Factions. Moving a country to a different faction is relatively easy. Just click a country's flag, and click \"Move to XXX\". The country should now be in the other faction. If somehow it shows up twice, you can press \"Refresh Teams\" to fix this."
    help_event.3.a:0 "Thanks!"

    help_event.4.t:0 "Swapping Countries Help"
    help_event.4.d:0 "You asked for help about Swapping Countries. Swapping countries is relatively hard. To swap a country, click on the flag of the country you want to move. Now click \"Select as Country to Move\". On the right, you will see an extra menu pop up, where you can select the country to move to. Click the country you want the player to move to. You should now see a flag on the right of the arrow. Once you are sure these are the countries you want to move, click the arrow. You will now get a confirmation message, and the player will have to agree to moving. After that, the swap will be done."
    help_event.4.a:0 "Thanks!"

    player_permission.3.d:0 "The Host of the game, [game_host.GetName], wants to change your Ideology. Do you agree to doing this? Not agreeing will lead to a vote, and if 80% of that vote is for, you will have your ideology changed regardless of whether you said no."
    player_permission.3.a:0 "I give permission"

    player_permission.7.d:0 "[selected_player.GetName] has given permission for any future ideology change."
