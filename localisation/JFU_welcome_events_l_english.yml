    JFU_welcome.1.t:0 "British Raj in the mod"
    JFU_welcome.1.d:0 "Hello and welcome to the mod. If this is your first time playing, or just need a little refresher, here is an event to help you out.\n\n British Raj is a vital member of the Allies, both in Africa and in Asia. You will almost always be tasked with clearing out Ethiopia early in the war, and possibly garrisoning ports in the Mediterranean. Later in the war you will have to protect your country against a Japanese invasion. You should do a staged defense, holding on the 2 biggest rivers in your country, one in Burma and the other in Bengal - also called the Dacca line -, and put any extra divisions you have on your ports, and after that in Singapore. \nIf you feel like you know what to do well enough and want to do something other than infantry spam or 7/2's or 14/4's, you should try going medium tanks. \nYou should rush the focus \"British Rail Investors\" first. Building infrastructure in high infrastructure (states you get infrastructure from in your focus tree) and high build slot states is recommended. "

    JFU_welcome.2.t:0 "South Africa in the mod"
    JFU_welcome.2.d:0 "Hello and welcome to the mod. If this is your first time playing, or just need a little refresher, here is an event to help you out.\n\n South Africa is a vital member of the Allies, mainly in Africa. You will be building an armored unit tasked with defending El Alamein. You should not be building motorized, instead, ask the United Kingdom to lend lease you these once you need them. \nYour tank bonus is one for every tank, so you can do anything from Light to Super Heavy. Heavy tanks are strongly advised, because you have the resources for it right in your country. Light tanks are advised against as they do not have enough armor to stop the German tanks, and Super heavies are advised against as well as they take a very long time to research. \nIf however, you want to go for a very late game you can do Superheavy or Heavy tank 3's. If you go medium tank, make sure you use the bonus on Medium 2 (or Medium 3 if you go lategame), and not Medium 1. Same goes for Heavy tank."

    JFU_welcome.3.t:0 "Canada in the mod"
    JFU_welcome.3.d:0 "Hello and welcome to the mod. If this is your first time playing, or just need a little refresher, here is an event to help you out.\n\n Canada is a vital member of the Allies, mainly in Africa, but also in any D-Day or operations in Asia. Canada has 2 options in the mod, for which you should ask your UK player what to do.\n The first option is to be the Allied Air controller. Canada has a couple bonuses very well suited to this mission, has a lot of oil through focuses and can buy oil from its neighbour if necessary. UK should lend lease his planes to you before the war starts, and France should do the same once he is at war. \nThe second option is to build Mechanized divisions. In this case someone else (usually the UK or Ireland) will be air controller, and you will assist in the defense of Africa. You have a bonus for mechanized, which you could choose to use on mechanized 1 to get a division out early, or to use it on mechanized 2 to have better mechs but have a division out later. If you feel like you know what you are doing and know you can get a Mech out anyways, you can always go for Light Tank 3's on the side. You have a bonus for the Valentine, which is very well suited for this. \nFinally, you should also build some Light Cruisers or Destroyers fit for anti-sub warfare."

    JFU_welcome.20.t:0 "Spain in the mod"
    JFU_welcome.20.d:0 "Hello and welcome to the mod. If this is your first time playing, or just need a little refresher, here is an event to help you out.\n\n Spain is an important member to the Axis. As Spain, you have a couple ways to play. First off, you can go Navy. You can do either Battleships and Escorts, or Submarines, and you can combine this with Naval Bombers. You have a bonus for all of these ships, and I suggest going for a relatively late build if you do this (get Nav Bomber 3's). \n\nSecond off, you can go very good Infantry. Spain has a lot of doctrine bonuses, infantry bonuses and artillery bonuses. This means you can get some of the most high tech infantry in the game. Combine this with very good advisors, you should be able to pull off some very good divisions. \n\nThird off, you can go Medium tanks. You have 2 bonuses for Light Tank/Mechanized, which you should use one of on Light Tank 2, and one on Mech 1. The second bonus for armor in general (Foreign tank design/Domestic tank design) should be used on either Medium 2 or 3's. This should lead to you having Medium 2's with relative ease. \n\nBuilding infrastructure in high infrastructure and build slot states is recommended. Make sure you also build refineries as Spain, and finally make sure you invade Portugal AFTER the Fall of France but OUT of the Axis. That way Portugal will most likely not join the Axis.\n\nBefore the civil war, you should not take any military advisors - in fact, you should not until you attack Portugal. This is because the Republicans will get the same advisors. Before the civil war, you should set up a couple divisions under the state Bilbao, to take the port (wait until the AI walks out of the port), and divisions to the right of Zaragoza and the bottom of the same state. This should cut off the AI's lines and give you an easier start."

    JFU_welcome.21.t:0 "Bulgaria in the mod"
    JFU_welcome.21.d:0 "Hello and welcome to the mod. If this is your first time playing, or just need a little refresher, here is an event to help you out.\n\n Bulgaria is a useful member to the Axis. As Bulgaria you have 2 options, with the latter only being a \"bonus\" option. Option one is specializing in Motorized Artillery or Mechanized divisions, to help defend when the Axis breaks through with tanks. Do know that you have to research Mechanized 1 even if you go Motorized, for the extra hardness on motorized. \nOption 2, which should never take priority over anything is Naval. You can get good subs or destroyers/light cruisers once you own Thrace or Macedonia."

    JFU_welcome.22.d:0 "As Italy, you will join the Axis and the war a month after Paris is taken. Make sure you are ready by then."

    JFU_welcome.23.d:0 "There are a series of historical unit events, and one focus for Germany. To prevent mass cluttering of division templates, I have set the events to your starting template names, if you change the names of them, the units will not spawn. Use your experience to upgrade these instead of making duplicates."
