TIPS_TEXT_1:0 "- You should try to stay on the highest trade law, even if you need to trade for a lot of resources, because it gives output, construction and research speed. \n- Mobilization laws are the most important thing to upgrade fast. \n- Most vanilla advisor traits have been change to make them worthwhile. \n- Always research your Tanks, Ships and Planes with designers. If you can't get a designer in time, just switch the research to something else - it will save the progress. \n- On light tanks, get a soft attack designer. \n- On medium and heavy tanks, get a hard attack designer. \n- Materiel Designers are almost never worth it. \n- Theorists are a good way to get Army XP in the Early Game. \n- The Air Superiority and Air Support modifiers on Chief Of Airforce advisors affect Land Battles, not Air Battles! \n- The Infantry modifiers on some advisors affect Special Forces as well, but not the other way around! \n- The Artillery advisor only affects divisions where the icon shows the majority is Artillery. \n- By not doing a focus for at most 10 days you can get a bit more PP to spend on advisors. \n- Make sure you do decisions to raise your stability as high as possible, since this gives you less consumer goods. \n- Don't do Emergency Factory conversions, unless you know you will lose the factories."
TIPS_TEXT_2:0 "- You can save up to 60 days on research, use this by waiting on other techs to complete or slightly lessen the Ahead of Time debuff. \n- If you are making tanks but not planning on using Mechanised, you should still research Mechanised 1. It gives a buff to motorised! \n- Higher level Infantry Equipment makes your Tanks better too. \n- Maintenance Companies are very important on high Industrial Cost (IC) units, since it increases Reliability. \n- Make sure to research TD, SPG and SPAA variants of tanks as well. They are cheaper than normal tanks and give buffs to specific targets. You can also convert lower level tanks into these, so it's even cheaper! \n- The first 2 Engineering research techs are a good way to shave off research time in the long run, but Atomic Research is generally not worth it. \n- Don't be afraid to rush Industry Techs a year or more ahead of time! Industry Techs are the most important tech. \n- Doctrine is more important than equipment upgrades, since you don't lose efficiency and they are generally bigger buffs. \n- Licenses give you an extra 20% research speed."
TIPS_TEXT_3:0 "- Before you buy a resource, see how much of a debuff it gives in your production line. If it is anything under 5%, or you need less than 4 of a resource, it's not worth it. \n- Buy from your (potential) allies first! \n- You can buy a lot of oil from a country for a day to quickly fill up your fuel supply. \n- If you are getting raided, buy from someone else for a while and the Trade Route efficiency will slowly be restored. \n- To see how many factories you are getting from trade, go to the Construction Tab. \n- Boosting opinion with countries will grant you access to more of their resources."
TIPS_TEXT_4:0 "- To see how many factories you are getting from your puppets, hover over the factory at the top left. \n- When constructing a building, holding shift while clicking constructs the max level of that building. \n- When constructing a building, holding ctrl while clicking automatically puts it at the top of the queue. You can also combine this with shift. \n- Building Infrastructure in states with high amounts of open slots can be worth it in the long run, since it buffs your construction speed. \n- Building Infrastructure in states with resources increases the amount of resources."
TIPS_TEXT_5:0 "- Swapping a production line of the same Archetype of Equipment (I.E. Infantry Equipment) results in smaller Efficiency losses. \n- You can click on the resources on the top to automatically go to the trade overview. \n- When hovering over the output per day on an equipment, you can see how much lacking resources affect the production. \n- Licenses are produced faster when you are in a faction and the less years difference there are between where you currently are and unlocking the tech."
TIPS_TEXT_6:0 "- You can Shift click on the \"Add Unit\" button to add 5 units."
TIPS_TEXT_7:0 "- Ctrl+B changes the way your units are moving - either from normal movement to Strategic Redeploy or the other way around! \n- B and then rightclicking strat deploys your units to the place you clicked. \n- H holds a unit and stops any movement or attack. \n- Ctrl+H unassigns a unit from a front. \n- When you have a Field Marshal selected, pressing Z, then holding Shift and clicking on a front you can make a Field Marshal Frontline without any General Frontlines. \n- You lose all your entrenchment when you attack or move from a province. \n- You will only gain Planning Preparation if you have an Offensive Line associated with an Order. \n- Air superiority or enough Anti Air is key: don't fight if you have neither. \n- On tanks you should focus on upgrading Gun first, then Armour while keeping Reliability at +-80%. \n- Make sure you have Signal Companies on 40 width units! \n- Attaché's are a good way to get some extra bonuses to and from your Allies."
TIPS_TEXT_8:0 "- You should keep your Airwings at 100 planes per wing. It is more efficient and easy to manage. \n- You can gain zone efficiency on certain plane types by doing a mission that can't be executed over a zone (I.E. a naval bombing mission on land). \n- Always make sure your planes are in the most optimal spot rangewise. You can check this by hovering over the efficiency. \n- Don't fight in unfavourable airzones or trades! Pull back until you can get enough planes, or airbases to contest the enemy. \n- If you expect to be putting Aircraft over enemy territory, upgrade Engine first on fighters. If you plan to fight over your own terrain, upgrade Reliability first. The Weapons upgrade actually lowers your damage over enemy territory since it lowers Reliability. On Bombers, obviously upgrade bombing."
