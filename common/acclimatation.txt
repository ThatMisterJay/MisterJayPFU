# Acclimatization is a feature, where a unit get's reduced weather penalty after spending much time in it.
# It is possible to add more types than just cold_climate and hot_climate.
#
# "gain_when" happens when any of the listed static modifiers is applied to the unit.
# The value next to it, is the % value for how fast the acclimatization should grow in this conditions.
# The % value is between 0.0 and 100.0 instead of 0.0 to 1.0 to avoid precision loss problems.
# So for example 0.05 is not 5%, but actually 0.05%.
# It is possible that multiple conditions are active, then the speed value is a sum of them.
# The total sum is multiplied by the balancing define: ACCLIMATIZATION_SPEED_GAIN (see 00_defines.lua).
#
# "weather_modifiers_reduction_factor" is how much does it affect the penalties from the weather's static modifiers,
# when the acclimatization reach 100%.
#
# "change_camo_when" may contain a keyword "snow" or any scriptable terrain type name. It's possible to have multiple values separated by space.
